# Sequential-code
# code for numerical experiment of Learning to Simulate Sequentially-Generated Data via Neural Networks and Wasserstein Training
# To train the sequential simulator, use notebook 'Training-unspecified_network'.
# Trained network parameters for multi-dimensional Heston and multi-dimensional polynomial are stored in the file 'Network results'
